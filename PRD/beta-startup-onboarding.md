- the intent of this feature / procedure is to be able to onboard beta testing startups and discuss with them features and shortcomings of the platform as well as their deck and project

- right now, people can register on the website as new users and will get a confirmation email for verification

- the platform will switch to closed beta right now
- so we attach a domain name (registered at namecheap.com) to the IP address
- when going public, we also need to switch from http:// to https://

- we will switch to a by-invitation-only user registration
- the login functionality has to stay, we make the "register" button grayed out

- a GP gets to know a startup and should be able to add their project via "new project" in the gallery view 
- the GP may then invite one or two persons from the startup to this project via entering their email in GP-only interface
- the startup needs to open that email, click on the invitation link and add a password when getting to our website
- after that, the project should feel and behave exactly like a project that a startup added when registering like the procedure is now

- the startup can login and see the beginning of the "funding journey" with stage 1 being active.
- they can then upload their document 
- after uploading a document, the startup has to see that the document is being processed, we may display phases like visual analysis, obligatory extractions and template processing chapters
- alternatively, the GP can upload a document that he received via email before.
- the document will be processed in the background and when the startup persons log in, they see the processed document already.

- the goal is that the startup can view their deck in the deck viewer and see what the visual analysis yielded 
- they can also see the results view with the chapters, questions, scores and scoring rationale
(- we will add commenting functions and a message center in the next step. this is NOT scope of this sub-project. do NOT implement comments & messages.)

- the GP may also transfer the ownership to one of the invited people
- note that GPs have access and edit rights to every project, it's just that the ownership can be transferred.
- goes without saying that the startups have the rights as all startups, i.e. they only see and work on their own project, no GP dashboards, dojo etc, no other startups' projects.
