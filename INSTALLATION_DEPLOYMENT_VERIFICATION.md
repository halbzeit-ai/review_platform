  ```bash
  # Run backend migrations first (older)
  for migration in backend/migrations/*.sql; do
      PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD psql ... < "$migration"
  done
  
  # Run newer migrations (including processing queue)
  for migration in migrations/*.sql; do
      PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD psql ... < "$migration"  
  done
  ```

  ```bash
  systemctl is-active --quiet processing-worker && 
      log_success "Processing Worker: Active"
  ```

### 3. **Environment Deployment Script** - ENHANCED ✅
**File:** `/opt/review-platform/environments/deploy-environment.sh`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Automatic Processing Worker Restart**
  ```bash
  if systemctl is-enabled processing-worker.service &>/dev/null; then
      sudo systemctl restart processing-worker.service
  fi
  ```

- ✅ **Service Status Reporting**
  ```bash
  systemctl is-active --quiet processing-worker && 
      echo "✅ Processing Worker: Active"
  ```

- ✅ **Component-Specific Deployment**
  - Backend deployment restarts both API and worker
  - GPU deployment restarts GPU HTTP server
  - Automatic service health verification

### 4. **Schema Creation Script** - ENHANCED ✅  
**File:** `/opt/review-platform/scripts/create_production_schema_final.py`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Processing Queue Table Verification**
  ```python
  processing_tables = ['processing_queue', 'processing_progress', 
                       'processing_servers', 'task_dependencies']
  missing_processing = [t for t in processing_tables if t not in tables]
  if missing_processing:
      print(f"❌ MISSING CRITICAL PROCESSING QUEUE TABLES: {missing_processing}")
  ```

- ✅ **ORM Model Integration**
  ```python
  # Import ALL models to register with Base (including new ones)
  from app.db.models import Base
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # Creates ALL tables from models
  ```

- ✅ **Enhanced Verification**
  ```python
  print("✅ All critical processing queue tables created successfully")
  print("Models: 32+ SQLAlchemy models (includes processing queue system)")
  ```

### 5. **Service Configuration** - READY ✅
**Files Verified:**
- ✅ `scripts/processing-worker.service` - Correct paths and configuration
- ✅ `scripts/setup-security-hardening-safe.sh` - Safe version with sudo user creation
- ✅ Environment files in `/environments/` - All production/development configs

**Service Integration:**
- ✅ **Systemd service management** for processing worker
- ✅ **Environment file loading** with correct paths  
- ✅ **Dependency management** (requires PostgreSQL)
- ✅ **Resource limits** and security settings applied

### 6. **Recent Migration Files** - PRESENT ✅
**Critical Migrations Verified:**
- ✅ `add_must_change_password.sql` - Force password change system
- ✅ `add_slide_feedback_system.sql` - Slide-level feedback functionality  
- ✅ `create_processing_queue_system.sql` - Complete processing queue system

**Migration Handling:**
- ✅ **Automatic execution** during installation
- ✅ **Error handling** for missing files
- ✅ **Logging** of migration execution

### 7. **Security Enhancements** - INTEGRATED ✅
- ✅ **Geographic IP Blocking** (China & Russia)
- ✅ **Sudo User Creation** before disabling root
- ✅ **UFW Firewall** with essential ports
- ✅ **Fail2ban** for intrusion prevention  
- ✅ **SSH hardening** with safe fallbacks

## 🎯 Installation Process Flow - UPDATED

### Fresh Production Installation:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-production-cpu.sh
```

**Enhanced Process:**

2. ✅ **Repository clone** and environment setup
3. ✅ **PostgreSQL setup** with remote GPU access
4. ✅ **Database initialization**:
   - Run both migration directories (`backend/migrations/` + `migrations/`)  
   - Execute ORM schema creation (includes processing queue models)
5. ✅ **Backend API service** (FastAPI with systemd)
