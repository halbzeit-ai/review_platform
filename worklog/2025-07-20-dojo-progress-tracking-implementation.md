# Dojo Extraction Testing Lab: Progressive Visual Analysis Progress Tracking

**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Components:** Frontend (React), Backend (FastAPI), GPU Server (Flask)

## Overview

Implemented real-time progress tracking for the Dojo Extraction Testing Lab visual analysis feature, enabling users to see progressive updates like "3/10 decks analyzed" and watch sample chips turn green as each deck completes processing, rather than waiting for entire batch completion.

## Problem Statement

The initial implementation had a "batch completion" issue:
- Visual analysis processed 10 decks sequentially on GPU server
- Results were only cached when **entire batch** completed
- Frontend showed "0/10 decks analyzed" then jumped to "10/10" 
- Users had no visibility into individual deck completion progress
- Poor user experience during long processing times (5-10 minutes per batch)

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Architectural Issue**: GPU server processed decks individually but only returned batch results at the end
2. **Caching Timing**: Backend only cached results when full batch HTTP response received
3. **Key Format Bug**: GPU server used integer keys, backend expected string keys (`str(deck_id)`)
4. **No Progressive Communication**: No mechanism for GPU to inform backend of individual completions

## Solution Architecture

### Progressive Caching Flow
```
GPU Server Processing:
├── Deck 1 completes → HTTP call to backend → Cache immediately → Frontend sees 1/10
├── Deck 2 completes → HTTP call to backend → Cache immediately → Frontend sees 2/10
├── Deck 3 completes → HTTP call to backend → Cache immediately → Frontend sees 3/10
└── ...etc
```

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. GPU Server Changes (`gpu_processing/gpu_http_server.py`)
```python
# Added immediate caching after each deck completion
def _cache_visual_analysis_result(self, deck_id: int, visual_results: Dict, vision_model: str, analysis_prompt: str):
    # Makes HTTP POST to backend /api/dojo/internal/cache-visual-analysis
    # Caches result immediately rather than waiting for batch completion
```

**Key changes:**
- Added `_cache_visual_analysis_result()` method 
- Fixed key format: `batch_results[str(deck_id)]` instead of `batch_results[deck_id]`
- Call caching immediately after each deck completes processing

#### 2. Backend API Changes (`backend/app/api/dojo.py`)
```python
@router.post("/internal/cache-visual-analysis")
async def cache_visual_analysis_from_gpu(request: dict, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Receives individual deck results from GPU server
    # Caches to visual_analysis_cache table immediately
    # No waiting for batch completion
```

**Key changes:**
- Added new internal endpoint for GPU→Backend communication
- Individual deck caching with proper error handling
- Immediate database commit after each cache operation

#### 3. Frontend Progress Tracking (`frontend/src/pages/DojoManagement.js`)
```javascript
// Already implemented - no changes needed
const checkAnalysisProgress = async () => {
  // Polls /api/dojo/extraction-test/sample with existing_ids
  // Counts decks with has_visual_cache: true
  // Updates analysisProgress state: { completed: X, total: 10 }
};
```

**Existing features that now work correctly:**
- 3-second polling interval during analysis
- Progress display: "Processing visual analysis: 3/10 decks analyzed"
- Sample chips turn green (`color={deck.has_visual_cache ? 'success' : 'default'}`)
- Real-time UI updates without page refresh

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- visual_analysis_cache table (already existed)
CREATE TABLE visual_analysis_cache (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pitch_deck_id INTEGER REFERENCES pitch_decks(id),
    analysis_result_json TEXT,
    vision_model_used VARCHAR(100),
    prompt_used TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(pitch_deck_id, vision_model_used, prompt_used)
);
```

### HTTP Communication Flow
1. **Frontend → Backend**: `POST /api/dojo/extraction-test/run-visual-analysis`
2. **Backend → GPU**: `POST http://135.181.63.133:8001/api/run-visual-analysis-batch`  
3. **GPU → Backend** (NEW): `POST http://65.108.32.168/api/dojo/internal/cache-visual-analysis` (after each deck)
4. **Frontend → Backend** (polling): `POST /api/dojo/extraction-test/sample` (every 3 seconds)

### Error Handling & Logging
- GPU server logs successful caching: `"Cached visual analysis via HTTP: deck {deck_id}"`
- Backend logs cache operations: `"GPU caching visual analysis for deck {deck_id}"`
- Frontend handles polling errors gracefully
- Database constraints prevent duplicate cache entries

## Deployment & Testing

### Commands Used
```bash
# Pull latest code on both servers
git pull

# Restart services  
sudo systemctl restart gpu-http-server      # GPU server (135.181.63.133)
sudo systemctl restart backend-service      # CPU server (65.108.32.168)
```

### Verification
- Started visual analysis batch with 10 decks
- Observed progressive chip color changes (gray → green) 
- Confirmed progress text updates: "0/10" → "1/10" → "2/10" → etc.
- Validated real-time updates without page refresh
- Tested with multiple concurrent users

## Performance Impact

### Before vs After
- **Before**: 10-minute wait → sudden "10/10" completion
- **After**: Progressive updates every ~30-60 seconds per deck
- **Network overhead**: +1 HTTP request per deck (minimal impact)
- **Database load**: Distributed writes vs single batch write (improved)
- **User experience**: Dramatically improved with real-time feedback

### Scalability Considerations
- Each deck completion triggers 1 HTTP call (acceptable for typical 10-deck batches)
- Database uses UPSERT to handle potential race conditions
- Frontend polling scales well (3-second interval is conservative)

## Files Modified

2. `093cb806` - Fix visual analysis batch results caching key format  
3. `0bcf415e` - Implement progressive visual analysis caching

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time WebSocket updates
- **Detailed Progress**: Show page-level progress ("Processing deck 3: page 5/17")
- **Progress Persistence**: Store progress state in database for session recovery
- **Batch Cancellation**: Improve cancellation to stop individual deck processing
- **Error Recovery**: Retry failed deck processing automatically

### Monitoring & Observability
- Add metrics for average deck processing time
- Track success/failure rates per model
- Monitor HTTP communication latency between servers
- Dashboard for batch processing statistics

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
1. **Progressive Communication**: Individual completion callbacks provide better UX than batch processing
2. **Key Format Consistency**: String vs integer keys can cause subtle bugs in distributed systems
3. **Immediate Caching**: Don't wait for batch completion - cache results as soon as available
4. **Frontend Polling**: 3-second intervals provide good balance of responsiveness vs server load

### Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven Processing**: GPU server pushing completion events to backend
- **Polling with Existing State**: Frontend re-checking sample status rather than tracking deltas
- **Internal API Endpoints**: Dedicated endpoints for service-to-service communication
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if progressive caching fails (fallback to batch)

## Success Metrics

✅ **User Experience**: Users see progressive updates every 30-60 seconds  
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Sample chips turn green in real-time  
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Accurate "X/Y decks analyzed" display  
✅ **Performance**: No significant impact on processing speed  
✅ **Reliability**: No data loss, proper error handling  
✅ **Scalability**: Works with concurrent users and multiple batches  

## Conclusion

Successfully transformed the Dojo Extraction Testing Lab from a "black box" batch processing system into a transparent, real-time progress tracking experience. The implementation demonstrates effective distributed system communication patterns and significantly improves user experience during long-running AI processing tasks.

The progressive caching architecture can be applied to other batch processing features in the system, providing a reusable pattern for real-time progress tracking across the platform.
