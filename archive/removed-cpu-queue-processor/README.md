# CPU Queue Processor - REMOVED

## Why This Was Removed

The CPU-based queue processor was removed on 2025-01-15 to resolve a critical architecture conflict.

### The Problem
- **Two Queue Processors**: CPU queue processor (this file) and GPU queue processor were both polling the same `processing_queue` table
- **Race Conditions**: Both processors competing for the same tasks every 5 seconds
- **Double Processing**: Tasks could be picked up by both processors simultaneously
- **Architecture Inconsistency**: CPU processor sent HTTP requests to GPU, while GPU processor handled tasks directly

### The Solution
- **Removed CPU Queue Processor**: This entire service was eliminated
- **GPU-Only Processing**: GPU server now exclusively handles all queue-based task processing
- **Clean Architecture**: Single source of truth for queue processing

### New Architecture
1. **Document Upload** → Queue task created
2. **GPU Server** → Polls queue and processes tasks directly
3. **No HTTP Overhead** → Faster, more reliable processing
4. **Backend** → Provides internal API endpoints for GPU communication

### Files Moved to Archive
- `queue_processor.py` - Main CPU queue processor service
- `queue_processor.py.backup` - Backup of the service

### Impact
✅ **Eliminated Race Conditions** - Single queue processor
✅ **Faster Processing** - Direct GPU processing
✅ **Better Reliability** - No HTTP communication overhead  
✅ **Container Ready** - Architecture supports future container migration

This change resolved the "Failed to send task to GPU server" errors and enabled reliable specialized analysis processing.
