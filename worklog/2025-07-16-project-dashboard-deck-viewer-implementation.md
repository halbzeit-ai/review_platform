# SESSION LOG: 2025-07-16 - Project Dashboard & Deck Viewer Implementation

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Focus:** Project-based deck viewer system with configurable AI pipeline and GPU processing fixes

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Implemented Complete Project-Based Deck Viewer System ✅
**Problem:** Need to verify that configurable prompts actually work and provide slide-by-slide analysis  
**Solution:** Built comprehensive project-based deck viewer with slide images and descriptions

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/api/projects.py` - Added project-based API endpoints for deck analysis, results, uploads, and slide images
- `frontend/src/pages/DeckViewer.js` - Slide-by-slide viewer with zoom and navigation controls
- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDashboard.js` - Project dashboard with Overview, All Decks, and Uploads tabs
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectUploads.js` - File upload management with lean list view
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added project-based API functions

**Key Features:**
- Slide-by-slide navigation with zoom controls (50%-300%)
- Side-by-side view of slide images and AI-generated descriptions
- Breadcrumb navigation and proper routing
- Project-based file organization

### 2. Fixed GPU Processing Path Configuration ✅
**Problem:** GPU processing was using hardcoded `/mnt/shared/` paths instead of `/mnt/CPU-GPU/`  
**Root Cause:** GPU processing code had hardcoded paths and wasn't reading from environment configuration

**Solution:**
- Updated `gpu_processing/utils/pitch_deck_analyzer.py` to load `.env.gpu` file
- Added proper environment variable usage: `os.getenv('SHARED_FILESYSTEM_MOUNT_PATH', '/mnt/CPU-GPU')`
- Fixed project-based directory creation: `/mnt/CPU-GPU/projects/{company_id}/analysis/{deck_name}/`
- Improved logging to show exact paths where directories and images are created

**Configuration Added:**
```bash
# gpu_processing/.env.gpu
SHARED_FILESYSTEM_MOUNT_PATH=/mnt/CPU-GPU
PRODUCTION_SERVER_URL=http://65.108.32.168
```

### 3. Implemented Automatic Database Updates ✅
**Problem:** GPU processing wasn't updating database with `results_file_path` after completion  
**Solution:** Added HTTP communication between GPU and CPU servers

**Files Modified:**
- `gpu_processing/gpu_http_server.py` - Added `_update_database_with_results()` method
- `backend/app/api/internal.py` - New internal API endpoint `/api/internal/update-deck-results`
- `backend/app/main.py` - Added internal router

**Flow:**
1. GPU processing completes and saves results to filesystem
2. GPU makes HTTP POST request to CPU server with deck ID and results file path
3. CPU server updates database with `results_file_path` and `processing_status = 'completed'`
4. Frontend immediately shows "Analyzed" status and enables "Deck Viewer" button

### 4. Enhanced File Management with Delete Functionality ✅
**Problem:** Users needed ability to delete uploaded PDFs and associated files  
**Solution:** Complete file deletion system with proper cleanup

**Features Implemented:**
- Replaced download icons with delete/trash icons in ProjectUploads component
- Added backend DELETE endpoint that removes PDF, results file, image folder, and database record
- Added confirmation dialogs and proper error handling
- Updated API service with `deleteDeck()` function

**Backend Endpoint:**
```python
@router.delete("/{company_id}/deck/{deck_id}")
async def delete_deck(company_id: str, deck_id: int):
    # Deletes PDF file, results file, analysis folder, and database record
```

### 5. Fixed Frontend Data Loading Issues ✅
**Problem:** "All Decks" tab was empty due to API response structure mismatch  
**Solution:** Updated ProjectDashboard to properly handle API response structure

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Handle the response structure: {decks: [...]}
const decks = decksData.decks || decksData;
setProjectDecks(Array.isArray(decks) ? decks : []);
```

## Current System Architecture

### Project-Based File Structure
```
/mnt/CPU-GPU/
├── projects/
│   └── {company_id}/
│       ├── analysis/
│       │   └── {deck_name}/
│       │       ├── slide_1.jpg
│       │       ├── slide_2.jpg
│       │       └── ...
│       ├── uploads/
│       └── exports/
├── uploads/          # Original uploaded files
└── results/          # Analysis results (JSON)
```

### GPU Processing Flow (Fixed)
1. **File Upload** → Saved to `/mnt/CPU-GPU/uploads/{company_id}/{uuid}/`
2. **GPU Processing** → Creates project directories in `/mnt/CPU-GPU/projects/`
3. **Image Extraction** → Saves slide images as `slide_1.jpg`, `slide_2.jpg`, etc.
4. **Visual Analysis** → Generates descriptions using configurable prompts from database
5. **Results Storage** → Saves to `/mnt/CPU-GPU/results/job_{id}_{timestamp}_results.json`
6. **Database Update** → HTTP POST to `/api/internal/update-deck-results`

### API Architecture
- **General Decks**: `/api/decks/` - Returns all decks for user
- **Project-Based**: `/api/projects/{company_id}/` - Project-specific operations
  - `deck-analysis/{deck_id}` - Slide-by-slide analysis data
  - `results/{deck_id}` - Overall analysis results
  - `uploads` - File upload management
  - `slide-image/{deck_name}/{filename}` - Serve slide images
  - `deck/{deck_id}` - DELETE endpoint for full cleanup

## CURRENT ISSUE: Visual Analysis Results Not Populated ❌

### Problem Description
- GPU processing completes successfully and creates slide images ✅
- Database gets updated with `results_file_path` and `processing_status = 'completed'` ✅
- Project directories and slide images are created correctly ✅
- **BUT:** Results JSON file contains `"visual_analysis_results": null` instead of array with slide descriptions ❌
- Deck viewer returns 404 "No slide analysis found for this deck" ❌

### Investigation Status
**GPU Processing Code Status:**
- ✅ Updated `pitch_deck_analyzer.py` is in `/opt/gpu_processing/utils/`
- ✅ Code contains `visual_analysis_results` initialization and append operations
- ✅ Path configuration fixed to use `/mnt/CPU-GPU/`
- ✅ Project directory creation working (confirmed by logs and file system)
- ✅ Slide images being saved correctly (verified in filesystem)

**Logs Show Success:**
```

```

**Database Check:**
```bash
# For deck 32 (latest test)
sqlite3 sql_app.db "SELECT results_file_path FROM pitch_decks WHERE id = 32;"
# Returns: results/job_32_1752701616_results.json

# Check results file
jq '.visual_analysis_results' /mnt/CPU-GPU/results/job_32_1752701616_results.json
# Returns: null
```

**Browser Error:**
```
GET /api/projects/ramin/deck-analysis/32 HTTP/1.0" 404 Not Found
Response: {"detail": "No slide analysis found for this deck"}
```

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### 1. Debug Visual Analysis Method
- Check GPU processing logs for deck 32 to see if there were errors during visual analysis
- Look for any exceptions or silent failures in the image processing pipeline
- Verify that `_analyze_visual_content` method is actually populating the `visual_analysis_results` list

### 2. Verify Code Execution Flow
- Ensure `visual_analysis_results.append()` calls are being reached
- Check if there's error handling that's clearing the results array
- Verify that the results are being included in the final JSON output

### 3. Test with Fresh Upload
- Upload a new PDF and trace through the entire processing pipeline
- Monitor GPU processing logs in real-time
- Check both filesystem and database updates

### 4. Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check GPU processing logs for specific deck
sudo journalctl -u gpu-http-server --since "21:30:00" | grep -A 20 -B 5 "pitch deck 32"

# Check for errors during processing
sudo journalctl -u gpu-http-server --since "21:30:00" | grep -i "error\|exception\|failed"

# Verify file structure
ls -la /mnt/CPU-GPU/projects/*/analysis/*/
```

## Working Features
- ✅ User authentication and project access control
- ✅ File upload with validation (PDF, 50MB limit)
- ✅ Project-based file organization
- ✅ Configurable pipeline prompts through UI
- ✅ Automatic database updates after GPU processing
- ✅ File deletion with complete cleanup
- ✅ Image extraction and storage in project structure
- ✅ Results display and navigation
- ✅ Project dashboard with three tabs (Overview, All Decks, Uploads)

## Pending Issues
- ❌ Visual analysis results not being populated in JSON output
- ❌ Deck viewer 404 error due to missing slide analysis data
- ❌ Need to debug why `visual_analysis_results` is `null` instead of array

## Production Deployment Commands

### GPU Processing Updates
```bash
# Copy updated GPU processing files
cp /opt/review_platform/gpu_processing/gpu_http_server.py /opt/gpu_processing/
cp /opt/review_platform/gpu_processing/utils/pitch_deck_analyzer.py /opt/gpu_processing/utils/
cp /opt/review_platform/gpu_processing/.env.gpu /opt/gpu_processing/

# Restart GPU HTTP server
sudo systemctl restart gpu-http-server
```

### Backend Updates
```bash
# Pull latest code (backend files are in git)
cd /opt/review-platform
git pull origin main

# Rebuild frontend
cd frontend
NODE_ENV=production npm run build

# Restart backend service
sudo systemctl restart review-platform
```

## Status Summary
**System is 95% complete.** The project dashboard, file management, and basic deck viewer are fully functional. The only remaining issue is that the visual analysis results are not being populated in the JSON output, preventing the deck viewer from displaying slide descriptions. This appears to be an issue with the GPU processing pipeline where the `visual_analysis_results` array is being initialized but not populated with actual slide analysis data.

The infrastructure is solid, paths are correct, and the communication between GPU and CPU servers is working. The issue is likely in the visual analysis processing logic within the GPU processing code.
