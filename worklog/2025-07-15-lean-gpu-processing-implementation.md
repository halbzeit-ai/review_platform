# SESSION LOG: 2025-07-15 - Lean GPU Processing Implementation

## Overview
Today we successfully implemented a lean, file-based GPU processing system for the AI review platform, moving away from complex on-demand instance spawning to a simple, reliable shared filesystem approach.

## Problem Statement
- **Instance Limits**: DataCrunch.io was hitting instance creation limits with on-demand spawning
- **Complexity**: SSH-based processing required complex authentication setup
- **Reliability**: On-demand instance creation was failing intermittently
- **Cost**: Constant spawn/destroy cycles were inefficient

## Solution: File-Based Processing with Shared Filesystem

### Architecture Overview
```
1. Upload PDF → /mnt/shared/uploads/
2. Create Job → /mnt/shared/queue/job_*.json
3. GPU Monitor → Processes jobs automatically
4. Save Results → /mnt/shared/results/job_*_results.json
5. Backend → Polls for completion and displays results
```

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. FileBasedGPUProcessingService (`backend/app/services/file_based_processing.py`)
- **Purpose**: Replace SSH-based processing with file-based communication
- **Key Features**:
  - Creates job files in `/mnt/shared/queue/`
  - Polls for completion by checking result files
  - Handles timeouts and error conditions
  - Updates database with processing status
- **Benefits**: No SSH authentication required, much simpler

#### 2. GPU Job Monitor (`gpu_processing/job_monitor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Daemon that monitors shared filesystem for processing jobs
- **Key Features**:
  - Continuous monitoring of `/mnt/shared/queue/` directory
  - Automatically processes new job files
  - Saves results to `/mnt/shared/results/`
  - Creates error files for failed jobs
  - Can be run as systemd service
- **Benefits**: Always running, automatic processing, robust error handling

#### 3. Updated API Integration (`backend/app/api/documents.py`)
- **Change**: Switched from `direct_gpu_processing` to `file_based_processing`
- **Impact**: Upload API now uses file-based approach seamlessly

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Shared Filesystem Setup
```bash
# Correct NFS mount command (documented for future reference)
mount -t nfs nfs.fin-01.datacrunch.io:/SFS-3H6ebwA1-b0cbae8b /mnt/shared
```

#### Step 2: GPU Instance Dependencies
```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip3 install --break-system-packages pdf2image torch torchvision requests pillow paramiko ollama

# Install system dependencies
apt update
apt install -y poppler-utils nfs-common

# Install and configure Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
systemctl start ollama
systemctl enable ollama
ollama pull gemma3:12b
ollama pull phi4:latest
```

#### Step 3: Directory Structure
```
/mnt/shared/
├── uploads/          # PDF files uploaded by users
├── queue/            # Job files created by backend
├── results/          # Processing results and errors
├── gpu_processing/   # AI processing code
└── temp/            # Temporary files
```

#### Step 4: Job Processing Flow
1. **Backend creates job file**:
   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "job_7_1752562725",
     "pitch_deck_id": 7,
     "file_path": "uploads/ra/9cf490d0-2388-4eec-b03f-a64ccd27e18a/ka-ex_pitchdeck.pdf",
     "status": "queued",
     "created_at": 1752562725
   }
   ```

2. **GPU monitor processes job**:
   - Reads job file from queue
   - Executes AI processing using existing `main.py`
   - Saves results to results directory
   - Removes job file when complete

3. **Backend polls for results**:
   - Checks for result files every 5 seconds
   - Updates database when processing completes
   - Handles timeouts and errors gracefully

### Technical Challenges Resolved

#### 1. Python Package Management on Ubuntu 24.04
- **Issue**: `externally-managed-environment` error
- **Solution**: Use `--break-system-packages` flag
- **Command**: `pip3 install --break-system-packages package_name`

#### 2. Dependency Conflicts
- **Issue**: System `typing_extensions` conflicts with pip packages
- **Solution**: Force reinstall with `--force-reinstall --no-deps`
- **Command**: `pip3 install --break-system-packages --force-reinstall --no-deps ollama`

#### 3. PDF Processing Dependencies
- **Issue**: `poppler` not installed for PDF to image conversion
- **Solution**: Install system package `poppler-utils`
- **Command**: `apt install -y poppler-utils`

#### 4. NFS Mount Path Discovery
- **Issue**: Incorrect filesystem path in mount command
- **Solution**: Use exact path from DataCrunch dashboard
- **Correct Path**: `nfs.fin-01.datacrunch.io:/SFS-3H6ebwA1-b0cbae8b`

### Performance Results

#### Processing Performance
- **30-page PDF**: ~10-15 minutes processing time
- **Per-page analysis**: ~20-30 seconds using gemma3:12b
- **Memory usage**: Stable throughout processing
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback for processing failures

#### System Reliability
- **Zero SSH issues**: No authentication or connection problems
- **Automatic recovery**: Job monitor handles restarts gracefully
- **Timeout handling**: 5-minute timeout with proper error reporting
- **Resource cleanup**: Automatic job file cleanup after processing

### Code Architecture Improvements

#### 1. Simplified Configuration
- **Removed**: SSH host, user, key path configuration
- **Kept**: Only shared filesystem mount path
- **Result**: Much simpler backend configuration

#### 2. Better Error Handling
- **Job-level errors**: Individual job failures don't crash the system
