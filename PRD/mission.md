# we are setting up a crowdfunding service here in germany it will focus on health startups and will source investors from the health domain (practitioners, med tech managers, care personel, pharma managers and the like). we are going live with a alpha version of the website right now, where people can log in by invitation only. we still need an introductory text for the website.

we wrote two texts already. a kind of manifest and an introduction to a questionnaire that we used to gauge investors' interest. please write an inspiring text that is explaining why we are doing this, our values and why we believe that what we do is out outmost imporance and impact on the german healthcare system.

Manifest:
We want the health ecosystem in Germany to thrive.
It needs to reduce costs and increase efficiency while increasing happiness for those working in the health sector.
We strongly believe that artificial intelligence, software, improvements in scientific methods and optimisation of processes are the key.

We think that startups are the most important lever and ingredient to improve the system.
We want startups to find product market fit quickly, learn how they can generate enough revenue and find a decent audience effectively.
We want to raise the awareness of innovations for health insurers as well as health care providers, physicians and pharma companies.

We want to build an organisation that effectively funds startups.
For this, the HALBZEIT is focussing on health startups exclusively. It is run by people who either have expertise in efficient health processes, AI and software or funding matters.
The organisation is addressing individuals to participate in funding rounds in a syndication format.
These individuals are exclusively sourced from the health ecosystem, i.e. physicians, medtech engineers, pharma managers and management running clinics or research institutions.

At the same time, we want to keep everybody happy and inspired.
Founders are being coached and offered help. We are opening doors to investors and customers.
We are also honest to investors and do our best to keep them informed about their risks.

Questionnaire Intro:
Die besten Ideen für das Gesundheitswesen entstehen dort, wo Versorgung gelebt wird – auf Station, im Arzt-Patienten-Gespräch, im Versorgungsalltag von Ärzt:innen. Doch genau hier scheitern viele innovative Lösungen – nicht an ihrer Relevanz, sondern an fehlenden Finanzierungsstrukturen, um die Unternehmen (Startups) langfristig im Markt tragfähig zu machen. Denn klassische Investorenlogik passt nicht zur Realität im Gesundheitswesen: Die meisten Investoren suchen schnelle Skalierung und Exits. Sie verstehen Marktdynamiken – aber selten Medizin. Versorgung braucht Geduld, regulatorisches Verständnis und Erfahrung in der medizinischen Praxis. Die Folge: Viele vielversprechende Startups bleiben auf der Strecke, noch bevor sie echten Versorgungsnutzen entfalten können.

Wir glauben: Es braucht ein völlig neues Finanzierungsmodell.

Ein Investitionsmodell aus dem Gesundheitssystem, für das Gesundheitssystem – mit medizinischen Expert:innen, die Versorgung verstehen.

Wir entwickeln ein neues Investitionsmodell, indem Ärzt:innen und medizinische Fachpersonen sich als sogenannte Business Angels (Investoren) mit Systemkenntnis gezielt an Gesundheitsinnovationen beteiligen können - darunter digitale Anwendungen, Plattformanbieter oder auch praxistaugliche Software. Die Idee: Kapital trifft Versorgungskompetenz - Wir haben große Ambitionen und wollen eine neue Art des Investings erschaffen.

Certainly! Here’s an inspiring, purpose-driven introductory text for your website, building on your manifesto and questionnaire introduction. The text aims to explain your motivation, your values, and why HALBZEIT’s mission is essential for the German healthcare system.

**Welcome to HALBZEIT – Enabling Tomorrow’s Healthcare, Today**

Healthcare in Germany is at a crossroads. As professionals within the system, we witness its daily challenges—the growing demands on medical staff, the inefficiencies embedded in outdated processes, and the limited room innovation has to flourish. Yet every day, remarkable ideas are born in clinics, labs, care facilities, and consulting rooms—ideas with the power to change lives and transform care.

Too often, however, these innovations lose momentum—not because of a lack of brilliance or dedication, but because the right support and funding structures are missing. Traditional investors often lack the patience, understanding, and sector know-how to truly foster sustainable healthcare innovation. Their focus on quick scaling and exits rarely aligns with the realities and rewards of transforming care.

This is where HALBZEIT comes in.

**Our Purpose**

We exist to catalyze meaningful, lasting progress in the German health ecosystem—always focused on what matters: better care, greater efficiency, reduced costs, and above all, more happiness for those who heal and care.

We believe that health startups—driven by practitioners, technologists, and caregivers—are the single most vital engine of needed change. But for them to succeed, they must be connected to the right capital, expertise, and understanding.

**Our Approach \& Values**

HALBZEIT is built by experts from medicine, software, AI, and healthcare management. We believe that the best innovations emerge where real care happens—and are best guided by people who know the system from the inside.

- **Collaboration**: We unite founders and investors who share a passion for medicine, technology, and care. Investors are not just financiers, but peers—physicians, medtech engineers, pharma leaders, and health managers—who bring deep system understanding with their capital.
- **Integrity \& Transparency**: We commit to honesty, clarity, and openness—with our founders, our investors, and everyone engaged in our journey.
- **Empowerment**: We coach founders, guide them to product-market fit, and open doors to customers and partners, always helping great ideas progress faster.
- **Long-term Impact**: We focus on real solutions that endure, improve clinical routines, and create measurable value for practitioners and patients alike. We measure our success not just in financial returns, but in the tangible improvements we bring to daily care.

**Why This Matters Now**

The potential of digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and evidence-driven practice in healthcare is enormous—but only if we create the right conditions for innovation to thrive. By funding startups from within the system, for the system, HALBZEIT gives new ideas the fair chance to grow, adapt, and ultimately change lives.

We believe this is not just important; it is urgent. Together, we can secure a stronger, more compassionate, and future-ready healthcare landscape for Germany.

Let’s shape the future of care—together, with purpose, knowledge, and courage.
