# Work Log Directory

This directory contains session logs for the HALBZEIT AI Review Platform development.

## Purpose

- **Track progress** across multiple development sessions
- **Document issues** and their resolutions
- **Maintain context** between Claude Code conversations
- **Record decisions** and technical changes

## Naming Convention

Session logs follow the pattern: `session-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Examples:
- `session-log-2025-07-12.md` - Email verification implementation
- `session-log-2025-07-13.md` - Frontend debugging continuation
- `session-log-2025-07-14.md` - AI processing testing

## Usage

### Starting a New Session
1. Create new log file with current date
2. Reference previous session if continuing work
3. Document current status and goals

### During Development
- Update the current session log with progress
- Note any issues or decisions made
- Track files modified and features implemented

### Session Handoff
When ending a session:
1. Summarize what was accomplished
2. Document current problem/status
3. Define clear next steps
4. List any pending tasks

## Log Structure

Each session log should include:

- **Current Status** - What's working/broken
- **Accomplishments** - What was completed
- **Issues** - Problems encountered and solutions
- **Next Steps** - Clear action plan
- **Files Modified** - Code changes made
- **Configuration** - Environment/setup changes

This helps maintain continuity across sessions and provides a clear development history.

## Integration with Git

Consider committing significant session logs to version control:

```bash
git add worklog/session-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md
git commit -m "Session log: Brief description of work"
```

This creates a permanent record of development progress alongside the code changes.
