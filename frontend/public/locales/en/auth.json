    "welcomeTitle": "Welcome to HALBZEIT – Enabling Tomorrow's Healthcare, Today",
    "missionIntro": "Healthcare in Germany is at a crossroads. As professionals within the system, we witness its daily challenges—the growing demands on medical staff, the inefficiencies embedded in outdated processes, and the limited room innovation has to flourish. Yet every day, remarkable ideas are born in clinics, labs, care facilities, and consulting rooms—ideas with the power to change lives and transform care.",
    "missionProblem": "Too often, however, these innovations lose momentum—not because of a lack of brilliance or dedication, but because the right support and funding structures are missing. Traditional investors often lack the patience, understanding, and sector know-how to truly foster sustainable healthcare innovation. Their focus on quick scaling and exits rarely aligns with the realities and rewards of transforming care.",
    "missionTransition": "This is where HALBZEIT comes in.",
    "purposeTitle": "Our Purpose",
    "purposeText": "We exist to catalyze meaningful, lasting progress in the German health ecosystem—always focused on what matters: better care, greater efficiency, reduced costs, and above all, more happiness for those who heal and care.",
    "purposeText2": "We believe that health startups—driven by practitioners, technologists, and caregivers—are the single most vital engine of needed change. But for them to succeed, they must be connected to the right capital, expertise, and understanding.",
    "approachTitle": "Our Approach & Values",
    "approachIntro": "HALBZEIT is built by experts from medicine, software, AI, and healthcare management. We believe that the best innovations emerge where real care happens—and are best guided by people who know the system from the inside.",
    "valueCollaboration": "Collaboration: We unite founders and investors who share a passion for medicine, technology, and care. Investors are not just financiers, but peers—physicians, medtech engineers, pharma leaders, and health managers—who bring deep system understanding with their capital.",
    "valueIntegrity": "Integrity & Transparency: We commit to honesty, clarity, and openness—with our founders, our investors, and everyone engaged in our journey.",
    "valueEmpowerment": "Empowerment: We coach founders, guide them to product-market fit, and open doors to customers and partners, always helping great ideas progress faster.",
    "valueLongTerm": "Long-term Impact: We focus on real solutions that endure, improve clinical routines, and create measurable value for practitioners and patients alike. We measure our success not just in financial returns, but in the tangible improvements we bring to daily care.",
    "whyNowTitle": "Why This Matters Now",
    "whyNowText": "The potential of digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and evidence-driven practice in healthcare is enormous—but only if we create the right conditions for innovation to thrive. By funding startups from within the system, for the system, HALBZEIT gives new ideas the fair chance to grow, adapt, and ultimately change lives.",
    "whyNowConclusion": "We believe this is not just important; it is urgent. Together, we can secure a stronger, more compassionate, and future-ready healthcare landscape for Germany.",
    "finalCall": "Let's shape the future of care—together, with purpose, knowledge, and courage.",
