0) please rebuild the upload functionality, for example the progress bar is gone, i'm even not sure whether the file is being uploaded at all

1) we added a lot of tables during the last 25 commits, for example the processing queue, the issues / comments and password change enforcement, check & update models.py
5) please write a database documentation that for each table describes which function is reading and writing it, use this documentation as a lookup, add to claude.md that you should first look into this
7) add to claude.md that you are allowed to look into the postgresql database
10) add to claude.md the rule that everytime you change the structure of the database, you update model.py as well as the documentation.

2) the process queue is probably not yet part of the environments/deploy script

3) please surface the deck issues prompt to the templates / obligatory extractions tab
4) please let the issues functionality look at the deck image instead of analysing the visual analysis of the slide

6) add to claude.md that you are allowed to list, ls, find, grep in the working directory and the shared filesystem

8) i will move you to the development server, please make sure that everything that we need is documented to update it like the production server
9)
