# Documentation Index

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the startup review platform. **Start here for any development, debugging, or deployment work.**

## Essential Reading Order

### 1. **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** - Start Here
Complete system overview including server infrastructure, component relationships, and data flow. Essential for understanding the big picture before making any changes.

### 2. **QUICK_DEBUG.md** - For Immediate Issues  
5-minute checklists for common problems. Use this when something is broken and you need fast resolution.

### 3. **PAGE_COMPONENTS.md** - For UI Issues
Maps URLs to components and functionality. Critical for fixing frontend issues or understanding user-reported problems.

### 4. **API_MAPPINGS.md** - For Data Issues
Field name mappings between database, API, and frontend layers. Essential for debugging data display problems.

### 5. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - For System Changes
Systematic deployment and service management procedures. Prevents deployment issues and service conflicts.

## Common Scenarios & Documentation Paths

### Scenario: "Classification not showing for startups"
1. **PAGE_COMPONENTS.md** ‚Üí Find that StartupDashboard.js handles `/startup` 
2. **API_MAPPINGS.md** ‚Üí Check that `/projects/extraction-results` maps `primary_sector` to `classification`
3. **QUICK_DEBUG.md** ‚Üí Use "Data Not Showing" checklist to verify API and database
4. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** ‚Üí Deploy fix using proper service management

### Scenario: "Can't deploy new features to production"  
1. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** ‚Üí Follow production deployment procedure
2. **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** ‚Üí Understand server roles and capabilities
3. **QUICK_DEBUG.md** ‚Üí Use service management and troubleshooting sections

### Scenario: "New developer onboarding"
1. **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** ‚Üí Complete system understanding
2. **PAGE_COMPONENTS.md** ‚Üí Learn frontend structure and routing
3. **API_MAPPINGS.md** ‚Üí Understand data flow between layers
4. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** ‚Üí Learn proper development workflow
5. **QUICK_DEBUG.md** ‚Üí Reference for common issues

## Documentation Maintenance

### Adding New Features
When adding new functionality, update:
- **PAGE_COMPONENTS.md** - New routes, components, or UI changes
- **API_MAPPINGS.md** - New data fields or API endpoints  
- **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - New deployment requirements
- **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** - Significant architectural changes

### After Major Issues
When resolving complex issues, update:
- **QUICK_DEBUG.md** - Add new troubleshooting procedures
- **API_MAPPINGS.md** - Document field mapping corrections
- **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Add lessons learned to prevent recurrence

### Documentation Standards
- Keep checklists under 5 minutes for QUICK_DEBUG.md
- Include specific commands and examples
- Update immediately after system changes
- Focus on practical, actionable information
- Include both positive (what to do) and negative (what not to do) guidance
